This tutorial illustrates the very basics of setting up a working Galleria gallery. If you're an experienced developer you'll be better off by checking out the quick start guide.


A basic HTML template
=====================

If you haven't got a HTML template yet, here's a good one to start with

.. code-block:: html

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
    </html>
    
jQuery
======

Galleria is built on top of the jQuery JavaScript framework. A number of large enterprises like Google provide hosted copies of jQuery. 

Add this inside the <head> element in your HTML to include the latest version of jQuery

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js"></script>

You can also download your own copy of jQuery and host it yourself if you wish, but this is not required.
